- **Ending explanations**: Detailed reasoning for why each word has its specific ending
- **Declension/Conjugation identification**: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th declensions and conjugations
- **Subject-verb agreement analysis**: Shows how subjects agree with verbs in person and number
- **Case usage explanations**: Why accusative for objects, ablative with prepositions, etc.

### Enhanced Symbolic Layer
- **Expanded Jungian analysis**: Comprehensive archetypal symbolism (Anima/Animus, Shadow, Self, Hero, etc.)
- **Joseph Campbell integration**: Hero's Journey stages and mythological patterns
- **Cross-cultural mythology**: Comparative mythological insights from world cultures
- **Depth psychology**: Individuation process and collective unconscious themes
- **Sacred symbolism**: Numerological significance and cosmic geometry

### New API Endpoint
```
POST /api/v1/dictionary/analyze/grammar/relationships
```
**Input**: Latin sentence + optional verse reference  
**Output**: Comprehensive grammatical analysis with relationship mapping

## üöÄ Example Analysis
