        'summary': 'Matthew\'s Gospel presents Jesus as the Jewish Messiah and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. It emphasizes Jesus\' teachings, particularly the Sermon on the Mount, and demonstrates how Jesus fulfills the Law and the Prophets. The Gospel is structured around five major discourses and includes unique material such as the Magi, the flight to Egypt, and the Great Commission.',
        'theological_importance': 'Matthew establishes Jesus as the Son of David and Son of Abraham, emphasizing the continuity between the Old and New Covenants. Key themes include the Kingdom of Heaven, discipleship, and the church. Matthew\'s Gospel has been foundational for Christian understanding of Jesus\' ethical teachings and missionary mandate.',

            'The Temple as representing Jesus\' body and the new covenant'
        ],
        'language_notes': 'The Latin Vulgate preserves many Hebraisms and Aramaic terms. The phrase "Regnum caelorum" (Kingdom of Heaven) appears frequently, translating the Hebrew concept.
